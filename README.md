# League Report Card
_Currently Under construction_

It is worth noting that the Riot API has recently changed version. Consequently, there are some deprecated functions in here. Will be updated when I get the time.

League Report Card offers much more than post-game statistics. 

With this application, users are able to see data from all games in the past year.
